# Comparing output

In this folder, we have a variety of systems for automatically and visually comparing output from flow-proto1, imageworsener, and imagemagick. 

Run `./install_tools.sh` to install everything except imagemagick (for that, you're basically on your own - but check /imagemagick.md in the root).

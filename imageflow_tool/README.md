# imageflow/rust Playgroud

So, first thing: THESE ARE THROW-AWAY PROTOTYPES. Don't use them in production, please. Test coverage sucks and we're validating theories & testing dependencies right now. 

Feel free to have fun playing around with the examples, though. 

1. flow-proto1 - This is a jpeg scaling tool written so users can verify quality/performance claims for Imageflow's most expensive operation (jpeg decode/scale/encode). 
2. bench.sh - This is a benchmark to compare flow-proto1 and libvips/ImageMagick. Please ping us if you can't [reproduce these benchmarks](https://gist.github.com/nathanaeljones/3c8e3600bfd5e440ecde670239d366dd).
